Assessment_4
Solve as a team

each one of you need to write down:

Sovle3:
1.did u understood the problem  - Yes
2.did u think though pseudo code - Brute force
3.what did u do right - able to derive solution faster
4.Did u ever solve using Brute Force - Yes
5.what did u do wrong - not able to optimize

How much time you took to solve it
analysis in excel - 15 to 20 mins


Sovle2:
1.did u understood the problem  - Yes
2.did u think though pseudo code - Brute force
3.what did u do right - No 
4.Did u ever solve using Brute Force - Yes
5.what did u do wrong - not able to optimize - Got Time Limit Exceeded

How much time you took to solve it
analysis in excel - 30 mins

Sovle1:
1.did u understood the problem  - After long read only understood
2.did u think though pseudo code - No
3.what did u do right - 
4.Did u ever solve using Brute Force - Partially
5.what did u do wrong -  have not checkded min length for all the numbers

9 to 10 pm
8 to 9 am tomorrow

Team 3:

Problem 1:
1.Did Not understood question
2.Not able to derive pseudocode as question is clear
3.with partial understanding we are able to clear few test cases but for hidden test cases code failed
4.did not do Implementaion via list , converted to Array and proceeded 

Problem 2:
Undertstood problem 
but did not derive proper pseudo code so test cases failed

Problem 3:
Did not derive the pesudo code correctly
So some test cases failed
